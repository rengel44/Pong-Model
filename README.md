Data Science Pong Model

## Model
The model I chose was linear regression. This was because it was learning and predicting the y value (paddle_y) based off of the y value for the ball (ball_y) which was my x. When the x value (ball_y) approaches paddle, the y value (paddle_y) will adjust. After doing some research and viewing the test CSV, this was the model that made the most sense to me.
